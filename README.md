This is my github repository following "CodeTrain's" Machine Learning playlist.

- [ ] Use predictions using a pre-trained model

- The model takes an input (an image)
- And outputs a matrix with with key, accuracy pairs.

- [] Project Files
  - We need a sketch.js and index.html with is our source file
- [] Text Editors
  - I'll be using VSCode (the kind of successor to Atom)
- [] Server
  - Probably will use the live-server applet

---

Scrap all of that. After doing a couple 'sketches' with p5.js, i've decided (before I do the Machine Learning Playlist), "Working with Data and APIs in Javascripts" first.

Though I did make a really simple tweet bot which I hope to improve to later on.

_Things I want to do_

- [ ] Continue "Working with Data and APIs in Javascript"
- [ ] Follow the WebSockets tutorial and build the real-time sketching app
- [ ] Create an tool to match names to food for Fire Emblem Characters
- [ ] Do more coding challenges on #CodingTrain
